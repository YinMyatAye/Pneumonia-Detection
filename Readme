# Pneumonia Detection Model (Google Colab)

A deep-learning–based medical image classification project designed to detect pneumonia from chest X-ray images.  
This repository contains the complete workflow executed in **Google Colab**, including data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and deployment-ready outputs.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

Pneumonia diagnosis through chest X-rays is time-consuming and prone to human error.  
This project builds a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** trained on the popular **Chest X-Ray Pneumonia Dataset** (Kaggle), enabling automated and reliable detection of pneumonia.

The workflow is optimized for Google Colab (GPU-enabled) to ensure accessible and efficient training.

## 📊 Dataset

Dataset used: **Chest X-Ray Images (Pneumonia)**  
Source: Kaggle

Categories:
- **NORMAL**
- **PNEUMONIA**

Each image is preprocessed:
- Resized to 224×224
- Scaled to [0, 1]
- Augmented (rotation, zoom, flip)

## 🚀 Model Architecture

A typical Keras CNN architecture including:
- Convolution + ReLU layers
- MaxPooling
- Dropout
- Fully Connected Layers
- Softmax Output (Binary Classification)

Optionally upgraded to:
- **VGG16 / ResNet50 Transfer Learning**
